Research Papers
Policy Incentives and Postsecondary Attainment: An Economic Analysis - Job Market Paper
In 2015, the Texas Education Agency (TEA) in collaboration with the Texas Higher Edu-
cation Coordinating Board (THECB) undertook an ambitious 60x30 TX plan as a part
of its implementation of House Bill 22, introduced by the 85th Texas House of Repres-
entatives to enhance public school accountability. The 60x30 TX is a higher education
plan that focuses on attaining a postsecondary graduation rate of 60% amongst the
25-34 age demographic in Texas by the year 2030. In this paper, I estimate the cost
per high school graduate of attaining this target. I also compare the per student cost
of this policy objective with that of two other counterfactual policies; the first being one
in which community colleges are made tuition-free for all high school graduates and
the second being one in which public four-year college tuition is subsidized annually by
$2,000 only for those who have completed an AA tuition free under the former policy.
I find that a policy in which community colleges are made tuition free will increase the
postsecondary graduation rate by age 29 to 26.6%, relative to a baseline of 22.6%, and
will cost $2,114 per student. I find that a $2,000 public four-year college subsidy for
those who have first completed an AA tuition free will boost the postsecondary gradu-
ation rate to 29.4% and increase the per student cost to $10,594. Finally, I find that a
conditional cash transfer of $5,320 and $3,640 for two-year and four-year college enroll-
ment, respectively, attains the targeted postsecondary graduation rate of 60% by age
29 and costs $16,569 per student with an estimated total cost of $2.3 billion. This is far
in excess of the THECB's FY2018 operating budget of $807 million.
Student Debt and Housing Market Outcomes - Working Paper with Naila Rahman,
Rice Institute
The rapidly increasing levels of educational debt incurred by American students raises
concerns over the effects that the debt could have on their ability to achieve their long-
term goals, including homeownership. While amount of student loan debt held by house-
holds has increased over the last few decades, homeownership rates among young
adults have declined. Additionally, if borrowers are taking out more loans to attain higher
education, then higher future earnings could potentially mitigate the effect of student
loan payments on home purchase. It is important to determine if the negative effect
of student debt on housing demand is exceeded by the positive effect that comes from
higher future earnings. The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between
student loan debt and housing demand.
Analyzing Unemployment Dynamics in the US Using a Structural VAR Approach with Sign Constraints - Lyon School of Economics, Spring 2013
This paper establishes dynamic features of the US labor market (1989-2012) within a
two sector construction, non-construction framework using structural VAR with sign re-
strictions. I show that a heightened unemployment rate in the construction sector was
an important driver of the unemployment dynamics during the Great Recession. This
can be explained by the cyclical sensitivity of this sector, with little reliance on invent-
ory inputs, and low separation rates of workers in the non-construction sector, so that
displaced construction workers could not be easily reallocated.
A Cross-National Flow Analysis of Unemployment in the UK, US, France and Spain - Madrid School of Eco-
nomics, Spring 2012
This paper examines the unemployment dynamics in the UK, US, France and Spain in
order to gauge the relative significance of unemployment inflows and outflows in pro-
ducing aggregate unemployment movements. I find that while unemployment inflows
play a dominant role in driving unemployment dynamics in the UK, France and the US,
both inflows and outflows are equally important for unemployment movements in Spain.
These results can be explained by institutional heterogeneities and interaction between
negative shocks and labor market rigidities across these countries.
