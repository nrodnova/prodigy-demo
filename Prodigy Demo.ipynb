    "## Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prodigy** is an annotation tool for creating and improving machine-learning datasets, especially for text, images, and audio.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s designed to be fast, scriptable, and developer-friendly — so you can build high-quality labeled data interactively, right next to your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Web app:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    What annotators see — an interactive browser UI where you label examples (e.g., highlight entities, classify text, correct model outputs).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Annotation Interface:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    An annotation interface is the front-end view shown to the annotator in Prodigy’s web app - it determines how you present a task (text, image, choice, etc.). \n",
    "    \n",
    "    and how the user interacts with it (highlight spans, select choices, draw boxes). \n",
    "\n",
    "    It is also referred to as a `view_id` in code and json configurations.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    There are multiple pre-defined annotation interfaces (such as Named Entity Recognition, Text Categorization, etc) described here: https://prodi.gy/docs/api-interfaces\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Prodigy also allows to combine several existing interfaces into one page (by using `blocks`), and create your own interfaces via `HTMLTemplate` interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Database:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Every annotation session is saved in a database — you can export or query results for training or analysis. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    By default, prodigy creates a sqlite database in ~/.prodigy/prodigy.db. \n",
    "\n",
    "    However, it can be configured to use an sqlite database located anywhere on the local drive, or to use PostgreSQL or SQL Server databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Recipes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Ready-made or custom Python functions that define what to annotate and how.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, ner.manual lets you label entities from scratch, and ner.correct lets you correct model predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Prodigy CLI:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Lets you launch Peodigy, see annotation progress, export annotated data and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Controller (advanced):**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The controller is the central part of Prodigy that manages the flow of data between your recipe, the annotation interface, and the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "    It's what actually runs a Prodigy session - deciding:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * which examples to send to the annotator,\n",
    "        \n",
    "    * how to display them in the browser, and\n",
    "        \n",
    "    * what to do with the answers when the user submits them."
